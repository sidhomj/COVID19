# COVID19

Adaptive Biotechnologies and Microsoft have recently partnered to release ImmuneCode, 
a database containing COVID19 specific T-cell receptors derived through MIRA,
a T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing based sequencing approach to identify antigen-specific TCRs.
Herein, we query the extent of cross reactivity between these derived COVID19 specific TCRs
and other known antigens present in McPas-TCR, a manually curated catalogue of pathology-associated TCRs.
We reveal cross reactivity between COVID19 specific TCRs and the immunodominant GILGFVFTL and LPRRSGAAGA
influenza epitopes, suggesting the importance of further work in characterizing the implications
of prior influenza exposure or co-exposure to the pathology of COVID19 illness.

In this github repository, all data and code are present to replicate the results illustrated in the manuscript.
Data collected from Adaptive and McPas-TCR can be found under the Data directory. All code required to recreate the main
figure in the manuscript can be found under scripts in Reproduce_Results.py or in the jupyter notebook Reproduce_Results.ipynb.

We would love feedback and critique of the analysis and ways to improve it! Thanks!
